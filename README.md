# ExampleNET6Mod
Simple example mod for il2cpp games that uses the experimental .NET6 version of MelonLoader

To compile yourself simply change the `<GameFolder>C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\MyCoolGame</GameFolder>` line in the `csproj` to your own game folder

(Also shows how you can automatically copy the mod the `Mods` folder after you build the project as a little extra bonus)
